## 0.2.1

- `--no-mutate` now avoids making a copy of the audio file, so that things are easier to
  clean up - this potentially hints at a different workflow for people who don't want
  their audio files moved in the first place?

# 0.2.0

- Fully (I think?) support non-Obsidian (e.g., Logseq, folders full of Markdown notes -- whatever, really!) Markdown vaults.

# 0.1.0

- Initial release
